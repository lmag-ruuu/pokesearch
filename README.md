Pokémon search engine using PokeApiV2  

Hi, I made a pokémon search engine using javascript, html and css. To avoid so many requests to the api, I created a dictionary in order to make search suggestions, it displays a list of pokemon when you start typing the name and you can search for those with similar names. Clicking on any pokemon (from the result) will show more information such as stats and items it carries in the wild. In the previous version I only had the javascript done, I took the task of redoing the cards (this time made by me) adding colors and one or another effect. There are still many things to improve but for my first project I liked how it turned out.
